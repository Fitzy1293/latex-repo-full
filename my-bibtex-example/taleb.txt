This is some rambling about a good book, filler text.

The belief that there are simple heuristics to understand cause and effect in systems that are random is widespread. 
Faulty thinking about how probability works makes people do irrational things.
People cannot easily take into account alternate histories, it is harder to imagine a different outcome than the one that already exits.
Reality actually exists, so people assign much more weight to the random events that made the present moment the way it is.
Random events with very unequal outcomes (such as getting \$10 million for playing a round of Russian Roulette),
the kind where one bad outcome wipes out all previous gains are not well understood by many people.
This is analogous to option traders, where you can lose much more than your initial investment.
Most of the time you will survive Russian Roulette, and most years option traders make a profit.
But when a bad outcome happens it can wipe out everything.
When a trader is making money they assume that they are doing things correctly, not just being a person amidst noise.
No one ever actually believes they are lucky, everyone wants to believe they are smart and figured out the system's rules.
Most complex systems have randomness as a dominating factor, but it is our nature as humans to find patterns, so we often times derive meaning from nothing.
